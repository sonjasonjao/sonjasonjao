## Hi! I'm Sonja 👋

I'm a programming student at Hive Helsinki, a coding school part of the 42 Network, with a background in Special Education. At Hive, I'm learning the fundamentals of coding through C and C++ projects in a peer-to-peer environment.
<br><br>
Alongside Hive, I am currently studying frontend topics, starting with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am particularly interested in diving deeper into accessibility.
<br><br>
In this profile you'll find both solo and group projects I have worked on at Hive alongside personal projects to practice especially frontend skills.
